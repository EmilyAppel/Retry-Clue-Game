<p>You check the revolver. It's an antique your father's had since you were a child. It doesn't work anymore, but maybe that wasn't the point of the message.</p>
<p>You look closer and suddenly notice a rolled up piece of paper in the barrel of the gun. You take it out and unroll it. It's from your father. It reads...&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Dear Henry,</em></p>
<p><em>If you're reading this, then my suspicions have been confirmed. Someone is plotting against me.</em></p>
<p><em>I've heard rumors for a while. With my age and weakening strength, it's unsurprising that someone would be looking for the chance to off me and steal my fortune. But I must admit, I thought I'd have more time.</em></p>
<p><em>I think someone at this party plans to kill me. I heard them talking on the phone about "waiting until he's alone," but I couldn't make out who it was. I think it was a woman's voice?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Regardless, I'm currently trapped in a house with a potential murderer hiding amongst a group of friends. I don't know who I can trust. And the minute that they start to leave, the closer the numbers will dwindle until I'm alone with the killer. Just as they planned.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't have much time. I hear footsteps and I need to find a safe place to hide until I can come up with a way to defend myself. </em></p>
<p><em>I'm taking th ehidden passage to my study.&nbsp; That should buy me some time. If you don't remember where that is, check the book in the hallway. It'll guide you there.</em></p>
<p><em>I'll try to hold out as long as I can. Please bring reinforcements as soon as possible. Or if it truly is too late for me, I will try to leave as many clues as I can in my stead so that you can bring whoever is responsible to justice.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Until we meet again,</em></p>
<p><em>George&nbsp;</em></p>
