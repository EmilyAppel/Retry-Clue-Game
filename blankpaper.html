<p> <a href="blankpaper.html">To whomever finds this, I don't think reinformcements will get here in time. And I have no way to defend myself without relying on someone ablebodied in this house. Which, seeing as one of those individuals is my future murderer, could be anyone.</a></p>
<p><a href="blankpaper.html">I am going to try and last for as long as I can. I don't think they know about the secret passage yet. But just in case, the passage is just underneath the floor by the main enterance. I will be able to hear who comes and goes from beneath the floorboards.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="blankpaper.html">&nbsp;10:05 - Professor Plum and Ms. Scarlet are saying their goodbyes to Mrs. Peacock in the hall. The door has shut, and only one pair of footsteps reenters the house, so I assume the two of them have left and Mrs. Peacock has returned to the party.</a></p>
<p><a href="blankpaper.html">10:40 - Colonel Mustard has now left the house. I can tell by his heavy footsteps.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="blankpaper.html">10:50 - Mr. Green has left the house as well. I heard him bidding the two remaining ladies goodnight before walking to the front enterance. So I was right in my assumption that the assailant's voice was a woman's afterall. Only two remain.</a></p>
<p><a href="blankpaper.html">11:25 - Both Mrs. White and Mrs. Peacock are talking on their way to the door. It doesn't sound like they're saying goodbyes. The door just shut. Could it be I was just being paranoid? Is there no one coming after me?</a></p>
<p><a href="blankpaper.html">Wait, I still hear movement upstairs. A dragging sound. Someone is moving the rug. She knows about the secret passage.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="blankpaper.html">I hear footsteps on the stairs.  She knows I'm here. She's walking so slowly.  I think this is what she meant bywaiting until I was alone. She knew I would come down here.</a></p>
<p><a href="blankpaper.html">I see a shadow.</a></p>
<p><a href="blankpaper.html">She doesn't appear armed, though. I can see the hands of the shadow, and they're empty.</a></p>
<p><a href="blankpaper.html">I have to stop writing. She can't find these notes, but the paper still needs to be visible so you can find it. Hopefully the invisible ink will dry in time.</a></p>
<p><a href="blankpaper.html">I think this is the end. Goodbye brother. Take care of my son. </a> </p>
