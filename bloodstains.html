<p> You get closer to the desk to see if youcan findany more information. You spot something on the rug. It's barely noticeable, but it almost looks like...</p>
<p>Blood.</p>
<p>You jump back from the desk in alarm. Even knowing of your father's murder, it still doesn't seem real as you stare at the spot where the crime must have taken place. You feel sick.</p>
<p>Strange, the rest of the room looks so tidy and undisturbed. You wouldn't have guessed this was a murder scene had you not known about it previously. Even the dust covering the surfaces looks intentional, as if left as untouched as possible for realism.</p>
<p>You don't know why this comes to mind, but you think to yourself that the killer must have a great eye for detail. Either that, or has experience with cleaning and tidying up difficult messes.</p>
<p>You've heard somewhere that bloodstains are particularly difficult to get out of fabrics. Maybe that is why a few traces of the crime are still visible like a shadow on the carpet. Small, easily overlooked, yet distinct.</p>
<p>Sloppy.&nbsp;</p>
