<p> You walk over to the table with the candlestick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It looks pretty old, like it's been there for decades. By the looks of the dust on the table, it probably HAS been decades.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>The dust.</p>
<p>There's a small area of the table that is untouched by the dust, but only that small circle next to the candlestick.</p>
<p>It looks like something used to be in that spot collecting dust for a while. It looks like the object in question has been recently moved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
